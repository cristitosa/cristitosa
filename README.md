**Socio-Technical System Analysis Researcher  | PhD in Civil/Environmental Engineering**

Welcome to my research portfolio. I am a socio-technical researcher (PhD Civil Eng) focused on designing sustainable urban transitions. My work integrates data science (Python, GIS), behavioral analysis, and policy/systems design to understand and shape urban dynamics, focusing on mobility, resource use, and community engagement.
