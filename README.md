**Socio-Technical System Analysis Researcher  | PhD in Civil/Environmental Engineering**

Welcome to my research portfolio. I am a socio-technical researcher (PhD Civil Eng) focused on designing sustainable urban transitions. My work integrates data science (Python, GIS), behavioral analysis, and policy/systems design to understand and shape urban dynamics, focusing on mobility, resource use, and community engagement.

#### 5. Norwegian Urban Morphology & Taxonomy (Open-Source Pipeline)
> A fully reproducible geospatial pipeline for classifying Norwegian urban fabrics using OSM, morphometrics (`momepy`), GIS, and machine-learning clustering.  
> Includes Google Colab support, modular scripts, and exportable GeoJSON datasets.

💻 **Repository:**  
👉 https://github.com/cristitosa/norway_urban_taxonomy

📘 **Features:**  
- Automated OSM building + street data extraction  
- Morphometric computation (coverage, elongation, shape complexity, fractal dimension)  
- Voronoi morphological tessellation  
- K-means clustering into Morphotopes  
- Visualization of urban structure + statistical plots  
- Full Google Colab notebook for easy reproduction  

 #### 6. The 15-Minute City Validator: Linking Urban Form to Transport Access

This project quantifies the relationship between urban morphology (form) and public transport accessibility (function). Using Stavanger as a case study, it employs graph theory and network analysis to calculate walking times to transit, empirically testing whether dense urban fabrics offer better service coverage than suburban morphotopes.

**💻 Repository:** [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/cristitosa/15_min_Stavanger_analysis))

**📘 Features:**
* **Network Analysis:** Multi-source Dijkstra routing using `NetworkX` and `OSMnx` to calculate catchment areas.
* **Service Gap Quantification:** Statistical measurement of "stranded" buildings (walking time > 10 min) across different urban types.
* **Morphological Integration:** Correlates transport efficiency with specific urban morphotopes (e.g., Coherent Dense vs. Incoherent Sparse).
* **Visualization:** Static academic maps and statistical reporting (Service Gap Bar Charts).


🗺️ **Use Cases:**   
- Urban planning, morphology research, transport analysis, urban sustainability modeling, automated characterization of built form.
